    In my free time I like to do indoor climbing. 
    For the most part I practice bouldering and sport climbing. 
    I have not tried rock climbing yet, but I am up for the challenge.

  summary: >-
    I dedicate a couple of hours a week to support open-source projects, 
    such as #riotpot an amazing honeypot from the Honeynet Project, and #midnight-sea,
    a generic crawler for darknet markets that I co-authored with two colleagues during my MSc.
